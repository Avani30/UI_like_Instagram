# UI_like_Instagram
I created three pages for a simple web-app using Angular functionality and visual
studio code, which is basically similar to instagram web-UI, 
1.homepage,2.dashboard, 3.profile.

1.homepage 
This is a Login registration page, created HTML, CSS files in the homepage Component section. If you click the “Login” button then the dashboard page will be open. 

2.dashboard 
page Page shows list of images and two buttons one is for Add new image and other for go to profile page, in every image if you click on image it popup details of image, on clicking “GO to Profile” button Profile page will be open. To implement those functionality, created HTML and CSS files in the dashboard component section, also added routing link in onclick buttons.

3.profile page
This page contains profile information like profile photo, bio, your post list. Created HTML and CSS files for this functionality implementation in the profile component. It has an “Edit Profile” button, on clicking that button it pops up details for Edit profile options like change password, email, username, edit profile photo. At bottom right there is one button ”Back” for going back to the dashboard page.
